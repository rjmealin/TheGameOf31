This is a simulation of the game of 31. The purpose of this project is to explore how balanced
The rules of this game are. The rules of the game 31 are as follows:
- Each player starts out with 3 cards
- For a given player to win they must get a total of 31 points in the same suit.
- All face cards are worth 10 points, aces 11, and the rest of the cards are face value.
- The left over cards are put in the center for players to draw from.
- When a player gets a turn they can choose from the face up or face down pile. 
- After a player chooses a card they must put any given card from their hand in the face up pile.
- A round comes to an end if either a player knocks or someone gets 31.
- If someone gets 31 then everyone at the table pays one token.
- If someone knocks after the last round the lowest person pays one token.
- The controversial rule is the knock rule.
- If a player knocks the table has one more turn each, not counting the knocker, and knocking
  Takes up a players turn.
- After the last round of player turns the knocker reveals their cards, if no-one has a higher score the knocker is safe and the lowest pays. If the knocker gets beat the lowest and the knocker pays.
- last man standing wins.
